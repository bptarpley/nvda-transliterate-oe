# nvda-transliterate-oe

This repo is a fork of https://github.com/yplassiard/nvda-translate. Instead of translating spoken text, however, it attempts to recognize whether a word is an Old English word, and if it is, it tells NVDA to pronounce a transliterated version of the word in order to make it sound more like the Old English pronunciation.
